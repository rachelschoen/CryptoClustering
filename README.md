# **CryptoClustering**

In this challenge, youâ€™ll use your knowledge of Python and unsupervised learning to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes.

**Answer the following questions:**

**Question:** What is the best value for `k` when using the PCA data?

**Answer:** 3

**Question:** Does it differ from the best k-value found using the original data?

**Answer:** Yes, 4 was the better k-value in the original data.

## **Visualize and Compare the Results**
Answer the following question:

**Question:** After visually analyzing the cluster analysis results, what is the impact of using fewer features to cluster the data using K-Means?

**Answer:** Reducing the features changed the inertia. So PCA had better results for clusters compared to the scaled data.
